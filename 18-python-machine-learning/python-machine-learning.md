# Python Machine Learning

- Machine learning falls under AI, overlaps with data science.
- True AI is defined as action being taken without it being programmed to happen.
- Machine learning and data scientist, data anylyst and research analyst are slightly interchangeable

## History of Data

- Witht he advent of large internet search engines we started collecting more data, tons of it, the problem is we couldnt use it all, was very unstructured so couldnt place it in relational databases - hence mongoDB and noSQL. To interpret the data we started using machine learning, they could create models to interpret the data.

## Machine Learning

- Teaching a computer to recognise something.
- Recognise a snake - Give a hundred images with snakes, tell computer all the images have a snake, now write a function/model to recognise snakes. Theoretically the more images/examples I give, the more refined the model becomes. Need to make sure the input is good, bad input equals bad output, bad input will create a bad model
