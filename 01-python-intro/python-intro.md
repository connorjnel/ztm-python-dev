# Python Introduction

Programming language - way to give instructions to computers
Computers operate in binary 1 and 0 otherwise known as machine code
Programming languages provide abstraction layer for humans that can then be translated into machine code
Python is a high level programming langauge, syntax is extremely close to how humans communicate
Python needs a translater to change it into machine code
Code is interpreted or compiled, Python usually uses a interpreter but can also use compiler

When running python actually running cpython - written in c and python
Python code > Interpreter > Byte code > CPYTHON VM > Machine Code (kinda like java)

## Python Syntax

print() - Prints enclosed to screen
input() - Allows user input
var = x - How to assign variables, variables have local scope to region, cant declare empty variables
concatenation - Similar to JS, just use "string" + var
`#` - Used to comment python, single line
docstring = Comments inside """Comment""" placed before or inside var/functions explaining what code does
