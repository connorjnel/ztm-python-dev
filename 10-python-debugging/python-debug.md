# Python Debugging

- No one writes perfect code, exceptions/errors happen
- Need to learn how to solve problems, find root issue and a way around it
- Try blocks are your friend

## Debugging Tips

- Use linter, detects errors before even running code
- IDE is better for larger projects, better debugging and testing
- Read errors, py is actually good with telling you what went wrong
- Use try blocks with explicit except with defined exceptions
- For debug can use PDB from py standard library, or debug in vscode or in pycharm
