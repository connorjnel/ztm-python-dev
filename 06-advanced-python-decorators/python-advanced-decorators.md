# Python Advanced Decorators

## Decorators

Decorators are the most common use of higher-order functions in Python. It allows programmers to modify the behavior of function or class. Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. In Decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.

tip - `del` - Keyword in py for deleting functions, objects, lists, dict etc
tip - var and func in py are first class, can be passed as arg,
tip - if passed by ref source object is deleted then object can still be called by child reference

## Higher order function HOC

Higher order function - function that accepts another function as argument or a function that returns another function
Tip - Map, reduce, filter are higher functions
