## Python Fundamental Data Types

int = integer = Whole number
float = floating point number = Number with fractions - Floats take up more memory than normal numbers, js weird exception
bool = True or false
str = String
list = Basic array type
tuple =
set =
dict =

# Math functions

round() = Rounds number down, can take second argument for nth digit
abs() = Return absolute value

# Developer Fundamentals

Dont read the dictionary - Dont try to learn everything, learn what you need when you need it, just master the basics and whats possible
Learn by doing, do practice, projects - Youll quickly learn the most used parts of it, Pareto principle in effect :D
Learn what is possible, dont learn every action or method, just what can be done then google it

# Python also uses a similar type of rule known as PEMDAS.

P – `()` - Parentheses.
E – `**` - Exponentiation.
M – `*` - Multiplication.
D – `/` - Division.
A – `+` - Addition.
S – `-` - Subtraction.

## Additional numbers

complex = Complex number type, you use this for heavy AI or Physics
Numbers are stored as binary values in memory
bin() = returns the binary value of a number

## Variables

Way to store information
`var = value` -> Assignment of variables is simple (also called binding)
VAR name best practices -> Use snake_case, start with lowercase or underscore, can include letters, numbers, underscore, case sensitive, dont overwrite keywords, make them descriptive
Tip -> Variable starting with underscore is a private variable
Tip -> Variables can be reassigned
`a,b,c = 1,2,3` -> Assign multiple values quickly

## Constants

`PI = 3.14` -> When declaring use capital letters, can be reassigned.
