# Python Fundamental Data Types

int = integer = Whole number
float = floating point number = Number with fractions - Floats take up more memory than normal numbers, js weird exception
bool = True or false
str = String
list = Basic array type
tuple =
set =
dict =

## Math functions

round() = Rounds number down, can take second argument for nth digit
abs() = Return absolute value

## Developer Fundamentals

Dont read the dictionary - Dont try to learn everything, learn what you need when you need it, just master the basics and whats possible
Learn by doing, do practice, projects - Youll quickly learn the most used parts of it, Pareto principle in effect :D
Learn what is possible, dont learn every action or method, just what can be done then google it

## Python also uses a similar type of rule known as PEMDAS

P – `()` - Parentheses.
E – `**` - Exponentiation.
M – `*` - Multiplication.
D – `/` - Division.
A – `+` - Addition.
S – `-` - Subtraction.

## Additional numbers

complex = Complex number type, you use this for heavy AI or Physics
Numbers are stored as binary values in memory
bin() = returns the binary value of a number

## Variables

Way to store information
`var = value` -> Assignment of variables is simple (also called binding)
VAR name best practices -> Use snake_case, start with lowercase or underscore, can include letters, numbers, underscore, case sensitive, dont overwrite keywords, make them descriptive
Tip -> Variable starting with underscore is a private variable
Tip -> Variables can be reassigned
`a,b,c = 1,2,3` -> Assign multiple values quickly

## Constants

`PI = 3.14` -> When declaring use capital letters, can be reassigned.

## Cheatsheet

[Cheatsheet](https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/python-cheat-sheet/#useful-libraries)

## Expression / Statement

Expression - Piece of code that produces a value `iq/5`
Statement - Line of code that performs a action `user_age = iq / 5`

## Augmented assignment operator

Assign new value without having to retype intitial value `some_value += 5`
A initial value needs to be assigned first

## Strings

Any text contained in single or double quotes
Python also allows three single quotes, can do multiple lines

## String Concatenation

Method used to add two strings together using + ex. `print("hello" + "there")`

## Type conversions

Can change data type by using str, int, float etc.

## Escape Sequences

When using double quotes inside double quoted string need to prefix \ in front of the enclosed quotes ex. `"This is a \"hot\" day"`.
`\t` = Adds a tab spacing
`\n` = Moves code to new line
