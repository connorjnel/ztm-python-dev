# Python Web Dev

- Tip - Can use frozen flask to deploy site to netlify instead of normal flask

## Setting up flask

- Python has a http.server module, NOT recommended for production though as it has limited security
- Better solutions are Flask and Django
- Flask is smaller and lean, only has most needed items included
- Django is batteries included, comes with a ton of stuff built in
- With flask use virtual environment - start with `py -3 -m venv venv`
- Activate with `. activate` - run from scripts directory when using bash, otherwise use `source <venv>/bin/activate`
