# Python Advanced OOP

Object Orientated Programming
Eveything in python is a object
Objects have methods and attributes that can be accessed with dot notation
OOP basically means we can create our own data types

## Classes

Naming convention is CamelCase
`Class` is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
ex. `class BigObject: pass`
`Object` different instances created from class, or instantiated from class
ex. `obj1 = BigObject()`
