# Python Advanced OOP

Object Orientated Programming
Eveything in python is a object
Objects have methods and attributes that can be accessed with dot notation
OOP basically means we can create our own data types

## Classes

Naming convention is CamelCase
`Class` is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
ex. `class BigObject: pass`
`Object` different instances created from class, or instantiated from class
ex. `obj1 = BigObject()`
`__init__()` - Use the `__init__()` function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created
`self` - The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
Tip - Each object is saved in a different memory location
