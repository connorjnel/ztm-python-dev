# Python Advanced FP

Functional programming is a style of programming that emphasizes the evaluation of expressions rather than the execution of commands.
Seperating of concerns, seperate data and methods/functions.

## FP Code Goals

Clean and understandable
Easy to extend
Easy to maintain
Memory Efficient
DRY

## Pure Functions

Functions are simple, have repeatable results, output is always the same if input is the same, does not produce side effects
Seperate the data of a program from function of a program
Side effects = Effecting the outside world, printing onto screen, changing var in seperate scope
Tip. print inside function is a side effect, so does outputting to outside variable
Tip. FP generally generates less errors as control is maintained, testing is easier, easier to understand
Tip. Pure functions are a guideline, not a rule. If something can be pure then do it, if you cant dont freak out about it
