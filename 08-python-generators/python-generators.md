# Python Generators

Generators allow us to generate sequence of values over time
Generators more efficient to create a iterable list when needed and acted upon rather than saving it in memory upfront

`range` - One type of generator, returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.
